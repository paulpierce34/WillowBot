# WillowBot
Fully automated bot for woodcutting Willow Trees specifically in East Port Sarim. Includes a banking function and will return back to woodcutting location

Proof of concept found here:

**NOTE:** The banking function created in this script will only work if you execute the script while standing in East Port Sarim next to the willow trees. Other than that, script will only work for woodcutting in other locations.


**HOW TO SETUP:**
- git clone repo
- pip install requirements.txt
- cd to script installation directory

**HOW TO USE:**
- python WillowBot.py
- CTRL+C to cancel script execution
- Must be run in East Port Sarim next to the 4 willow trees

**TIPS:**
- If you're having trouble with accuracy, try to imitate the screen resolution/zoom/camera angle shown in the above youtube video. Also, while not mandatory, having sprint enabled makes script much more smooth. This is by no means a finished product, but it's a start!
